# Pascal-middle-and-tringular
Compares the middle numbers of the Pascal's triangle with the triangular diagonal
of the Pascal's triangle and prints out the numbers that are common. 
By finding the numbe that is common for both of them, it proves that there is
a number that appears EXACTLY five times in a pascal's triangle. The reason 
it is exactly is because if it appears in middle collum of the triangle and 
triangular,then it has to appear in the counting diagonal of the triangle.
(1 middle number + 2 triangular numebrs + 2 counting numbers = 5)
